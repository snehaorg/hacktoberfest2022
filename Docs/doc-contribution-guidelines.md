First, we would like to encourage you to contribute to an open source Devtron docs repository with meaningful PR. 

When you are contributing to the Devtron documentation, please read these contribution guidelines carefully.

- When you are working on an issue, please let everyone know by leaving a comment on the Github issue.
- Aim for a voice and tone that's conversational, friendly, and respectful which does not sound so pushy.
- Keep your writing style consistent throughout your documentation.
- Use the active voice more often than the passive voice to keep a sentence shorter and to the point.
- Address the audience of product documentation as “you” (2nd person singular) instead of “user” (3rd person singular).
- Write in the steps (1…2….3…)  in imperative sentences if a user has to perform actions/tasks.
- Include the screenshots from the Devtron dashboard application.
- Do Not use unnecessary capitalization except titles (all-caps for first initial letters).

If you're interested in writing new content or in thoroughly revising existing content, open an issue describing what you want to do.
Get feedback on your proposal.

If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to ask in our [discord community](https://discord.devtron.ai/) in #hacktoberfest channel.
